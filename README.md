# Hardik Hyperion Processor

Developed a RISC CPU involving ALU, 8 Registers and ROM. Also includes a Python Script [InstructionTemplateGenerator.py](InstructionTemplateGenerator.py) to generate the instruction template for the processor.

## RISC CPU Architecture

- 4 bit CPU
- 8 registers
- Microcontroller-based Processor

## Memory

- Read-only Memory
- 256 x 16 = 4096 bits of memory.
- 1 Instruction takes 16 bits.
- Atmost 256 instructions (16 bit each) can be stored in ROM.
